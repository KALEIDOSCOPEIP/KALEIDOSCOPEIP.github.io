        <b>Behavioral Safety Identification System for Substation Workers</b><br/>
        Based on camera footage, we designed a software platform to identify substation workers' behavior to ensure safety regulations, including wearing the worker uniform and the helmet, opening the electrical box with the correct gadgets, and operating the devices with appropriate actions. I completed this project on September 2022.

## Misc 💡
- My hometown is Guilin ([Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ne281Q9Kp1wXt4Qu5), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilin)), a beautiful city with stunning natural landscapes of karst topography ⛰️ 🏞.
- I am addicted to music 24/7 🎵🎶 without music I think I might die. I sometimes record and edit music for fun, and hope to learn more about music production.
- Amateur photography enthusiast 📷. I find my surroundings always worthy of a picture taken because I believe everything is beautiful in its own way. When I purchase a new phone, its camera capacity is one of my focuses.
- I was a dancer when I was young 🕺. Even though I don't dance like before nowadays, I am still looking forward to reinvigorating my passion for dancing.
- I love city walking 🚶! I have a goal that I want to explore every corner of each city I spend time living in. Yes, those fancy malls and tourist attractions excite me and I love them dearly, but usually I would like to walk into the quiet alley and observe the ordinary life of ordinary people.
- I love experiencing new stuff 🤩! Concerts, live houses, exhibitions, operas, musicals, movies, hiking, biking... anything!
